Drag Code for Air Brake Activation

The purpose of this code is to analyze and assess the proper time to
activate the air brakes in order to have the rocket reach its desired
apogee. The program will require the drag coefficients of the rocket with
the air brakes active and closed, the desired height, and standard
dimensions of the rocket and environment.
